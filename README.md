# Accident---Project
The Task.
Imagine that you are a data scientist confronted with this data (this is not far from the truth!). Your task
is to advise government agencies about how to improve road safety and create a model that would
predict such accidents and the injuries that they incur.

Importantly, we have used and will be using time within our workshops to help with this assignment, and it doesnâ€™t have to be all completed at once.

The questions (at minimum) that the assignment should address are as follows:

Are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which accidents occur?
For motorbikes, are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which accidents occur? We suggest a focus on: Motorcycle 125cc and under, Motorcycle over 125cc and up to 500cc, and Motorcycle over 500cc.
For pedestrians involved in accidents, are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which they are more likely to be involved?
Using the apriori algorithm, explore the impact of selected variables on accident severity.  
Identify accidents in our region: Kingston upon Hull, Humberside, and the East Riding of Yorkshire etc. You can do this by filtering on LSOA, or police region or another method if you can find one. Run clustering on this data. What do these clusters reveal about the distribution of accidents in our region? 
Using outlier detection methods, identify unusual entries in your data set. Should you keep these entries in your data? 
Can you develop a classification model using the provided data that accurately predicts fatal injuries sustained in road traffic accidents, with the aim of informing and improving road safety measures?
Your Report.
Please structure your report as follows.
Short introduction. No more than a few sentences introducing the dataset and the problems
that you seek to solve using it.
Analysis. Present an analysis of the data, including any visualizations, that address the
questions (1)-(6), above. This should be broken down in to analysing when, where, and under
what conditions accidents happen, as per the questions above. Document any data cleaning relevant to the analysis here. 
Predictions. This should be a working model to address point (7), above, that can predict whether an accident is fatal given the conditions it happened under.
Recommendations. What recommendations can be made to government agencies based on this data and your analysis to improve safety? Keep this to your top 4 or 5 bullet points.
